PhySim
======

## The What

This is the official repo for a physics simulator called (surprise, surprise) PhySim!


## The Why

This is the term project for 4 of us, but I (Yatharth) am simply in this for fun and to learn and lend a helping hand.


## The Where

While this meant to be a private project, we loved using GitHub and so are using it here anyway.

Most of our discussion takes place in our [Google+ Community][google] and project details on our [Trello board][trello] _(note: both are private)_.
